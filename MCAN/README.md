## Modular Co-Attention Network

You can use this repo to work with the MCAN model. 

The official documentation is provided in a library which the authors have created called OpenVQA : https://github.com/MILVLG/openvqa. 
We recommend checking this library as it provides the current and previous state-of-the-art models and weights. 
The code is developed in Pytorch.

The official documentation link is : https://openvqa.readthedocs.io
However, we recommend starting form here: https://openvqa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/basic/getting_started.html


The authors behind the creation of this model have provided an in depth analysis how to use attention networks effectively.
